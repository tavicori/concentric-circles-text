# Concentric Circles Text

Text written in concentric circles. Made with [DrawBot](https://www.drabot.com).

## About

This code was originally made for the visual identity of the music album **Grão — Território Percussivo**, by Léo de Paula.

## Examples  

### Basic output  
![basic-output](./examples/grao-territorio-percussivo.png "Basic output").  

### The way that the output image was used on the compact disk

## PS  
As it seems on the mockups, i've used the font [Botanika Mono](https://www.suitcasetype.com/fonts/botanika) (Tomáš Brousil / Suitcase Type Foundry) for the text. Because of licensing restrictions, this code has been set to work with **Courier**. Using a typography whose glyphs are the same width is preferable and produces a better result.
